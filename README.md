# Projects

This Project is a work in progress.
In this project i will use the minst handwritten numbers images. The images are sperated randomly into 3 different TFRecords files (test data, validation data and training data).
The TFRecords files are extracted into datasets and used in a small convolution neural network. 
In future i will implement changes to make this script run on a TPU if available.
